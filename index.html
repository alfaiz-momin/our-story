				<p class="gray-color">Einstein said the definition of insanity is "Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." And isn't it fair to say the advertising industry is insane?</p><br>
				<p class="gray-color">Advertising hasn't changed since the dawn of time. Ads are annoying, interruptive and rarely provide any sense of real value to anyone. So why do they keep doing it that way?  Because there's no other option!</p><br>
				<p class="gray-color">And that's why we invented ctalyst®.  ctalyst® <span class="sky-color">is</span> the better way.</p><br>
				<p class="gray-color">Disrupted Logic's ctalyst® is the <span class="sky-color">NEXT GENERATION</span> of advertising. It's interactive, it's social, it's engaging and it never interrupts or annoys. An ad served by ctalyst® is always welcomed by the audience, because ctalyst™ ads are always relevant and fun.</p><br>
				<p class="gray-color">ctalyst's legacy is founded on a wealth of world-class entertainment experiences and accomplishments in the motion picture, television and video game industries.  Our heart and soul is centered around our core belief in pushing the boundaries while stepping outside our comfort zones to accomplish something truly extraordinary.  The goal is incredibly important, but its also about the journey ... both of which are the result of our vision, passion and drive for technological innovation.</p>
